// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


a + b = c


num1 + num2 = sum
print sum


ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


1. Ask the user to input the first number (‘num1’).
2. Ask the user to input the second number (‘num2’).
3. Add ‘num1’ and ‘num2’ together and store the result in ‘sum’.
4. Print the value of ‘sum’.

Pseudo code
# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Add num1 and num2 together and store the result in sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Step 4: Print the value of sum
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
1. Ask the user to input a number (num).
2. Check if num is divisible by 2.
   " If it is, print "The number is even."
   " If it is not, print "The number is odd."

Pseudo code

# Step 1: Ask the user to input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Step 2: Check if num is divisible by 2
if num % 2 == 0:
    # If it is, print "The number is even."
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    # If it is not, print "The number is odd."
    print("The number is odd.")



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Initialize a variable total to 0.
2. Repeat the following steps 5 times:
   " Ask the user to input a number.
   " Add the input number to total.
3. Calculate the average by dividing the total by 5.
4. Print the average.

Pseudo code
# Step 1: Initialize a variable total to 0
total = 0

# Step 2: Repeat the following steps 5 times
for _ in range(5):
    # Ask the user to input a number
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    # Add the input number to total
    total += num

# Step 3: Calculate the average by dividing total by 5
average = total / 5

# Step 4: Print the average
print("The average of the five numbers is:", average)
